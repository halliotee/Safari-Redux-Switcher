Redux Switcher
==============

A Safari version of [@whomwah's Chrome Extension](https://github.com/whomwah/Redux-Switcher/). To quote him:

"An extension that extends a BBC Programmes episode page, and 
provides a link to the relevant Redux page. If you don't know what
Redux is, and don't have an account, this extension is no use to you."

A compiled version of the extension is available by hitting the "Downloads"
button on this repo.
